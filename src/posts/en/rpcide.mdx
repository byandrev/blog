Today, I am excited to announce the fruits of the effort and dedication in the development of RPCIDE.

RPCIDE is an [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) focused on competitive programming. This IDE goes beyond conventional IDEs, as it is tailored to meet the unique needs of competitive programming.

One of the key features of RPCIDE is its integration with programming languages commonly used in programming competitions, including Java, Javascript, Python, C++, and Go.

### A little history

RPCIDE was created in January of this year (2023). In its early days, I released a beta version, which showed promise but had certain limitations. I noticed that there was a significant room for improvement to take the competitive programming experience to the next level. Feedback from beta users was essential in identifying areas of enhancement and key features that needed to be implemented.

After many cups of coffee â˜• and nights of coding, I managed to complete a more robust and comprehensive version of RPCIDE, which I will now present to you.

### More Intuitive and User-Friendly Interface

Carefully designed to provide users with a more intuitive and user-friendly interface that further enhances their competitive programming experience.

The interface has been redesigned to display menus and options in an intuitive and organized manner, allowing quick access to necessary tools and functions. Descriptive icons and buttons streamline navigation and eliminate the need for searching in multiple places.

### Multiple language support

Extensive support for multiple programming languages has been added, giving users the freedom to choose the language they feel most comfortable and familiar with.

### Learn with the RPCIDE

Within RPCIDE, free access is provided to a set of educational resources designed to accelerate learning in the field of competitive programming. Currently, only the [Competitive Programming with Python](https://rpcide.cloud/learning/python) section is available, but more content will be continuously created.

In summary, the evolution of RPCIDE from its initial beta version to the current release has been an exciting journey during which I have learned a lot. I look forward to continuing to work on this wonderful project and improving it further with each step.

I invite you to explore RPCIDE and embark on the wonderful journey of competitive programming. If you share it with people who could benefit from it, you would greatly help me.
