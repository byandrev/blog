I like to say that competitive programming is like a sport where programmers compete against each other to solve programming problems within a limited time. I will show you the steps you should follow to get started in this.

## Benefits of Competitive Programming

Competitive programming offers numerous benefits, including:

- It helps improve your programming skills.
- Enhances your problem-solving abilities.
- Encourages analytical, creative, and logical thinking.
- Provides opportunities to connect with fellow programmers.

### Learn the Fundamentals of a Programming Language

Before diving into competitive programming, it's crucial to have a solid command of the fundamentals of programming. Familiarize yourself with a programming language like Python, C++, or Java, and understand basic concepts such as variables, control structures, functions, and data structures.

Here are some resources to learn the fundamentals of programming:

- [Learn Python - RPCIDE](https://rpcide-next.vercel.app/learning/python)
- [Learn Python](https://aprendepython.es)

### Study Basic Data Structures

Competitive programming involves solving problems as quickly as possible, so being familiar with common data structures and algorithms is essential. I recommend practicing with arrays, maps (dictionaries in Python), matrices, queues, stacks, etc.

Here are some resources to learn basic data structures:

- [C++'s Built-In Data Structures](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/c-plus-plus-for-programmers/modules/cpp-built-in-data-structures/cheatsheet)
- [Learn DS & Algorithms](https://www.programiz.com/dsa)

### Practice, Practice, Practice

There are numerous online platforms designed specifically for competitive programming, such as [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), and [TrainingCenterUFPS](https://trainingcenter.cloud.ufps.edu.co). Register on one or more of these platforms and participate in the challenges and competitions they offer.

Competitive programming is an exciting challenge that will allow you to improve your programming skills and develop analytical thinking. I hope you have fun with it!

To program effectively, having a good working environment is important. That's why I recommend the online IDE [RPCIDE](https://www.rpcide.cloud), developed by me, which is specifically focused on competitive programming.
